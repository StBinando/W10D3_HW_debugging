# Introduction to Debugging in IDE

## Learning Objectives
- Know how to debug a Java application

- Understand the debugger console
- Know how to evaluate code fragments

## Task
As an introduction to debugging:
- watch the following video: [Intro to Debugging video](https://youtu.be/ErVZrVWZrko)


Answer the following questions:
####1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?
    defines a point where to pause the code from running in order to inspect it

####3. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?
    no; it stops just before that line and launches the debugger

####3. How do we debug the next line of code?
    by using the options in the debug console, , i.e. step over + step into

####4. What does the step into command do?
    jumps to code called by the line where the debugger is paused

####5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?
    with evaluate expression we can run a single line of code;
    with evaluate code fragment we can run multiple ones
